## Pre-requisites
Navigating through this project requires you to at least have a fundamental level of understanding of the following:

1. [CSS/Bootstrap 5 Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
2. [React Bootstrap Framework](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/introduction)
3. [Redux Framework (Incl. Redux Persist)](https://redux.js.org/)
4. [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
5. [Fetch Requests via Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
6. [Google Firebase Setup - Social Platform Authentication](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)
7. [REST APIs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rest-api-introduction/) and hosting (IP Addresses, ports, etc.).
8. [How environment variables/secrets work](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode)

## Features
1. **Authentication**
Registration and Login via Email/Password, Google, Facebook.

2. **Email Verification**
Using Mailgun third party services. Free mailgun accounts only allow up to 5 manually authorized emails to work. Thus, kindly send an email to **leowkeantat@gmail.com** to request for this feature to work.

3. **Mobile Phone Number** Verification (WIP)
SMS OTP before registration form is submitted to back-end to verify phone validity. Most of the inner workings are from the back-end server. Using Telesign third party service, free account has a limited amount of verifications before the free credits expire. Once expired, back-end server will only ensure that no duplicate numbers will be permitted and SMS code prompts will be disabled from then on.

5. **CRUD Functionalities** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Schedule, manage and coordinate event bookings with the team! The front-end side mainly deals with consumers, in this case, the prospective clients (Music Company Agents, Band Agents, etc.) desiring to make their future band tour in a certain country a reality.

6. **Payment Gateway** (Development Mode - WIP)
Stripe. Since it is a mock app for educational purposes only, it will stay in this mode (no actual transactions will be made) perpetually.
